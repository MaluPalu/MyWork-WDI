# Error-Handling & Validations

### Why is this important?
<!-- framing the "why" in big-picture/real world examples -->
*This workshop is important because:*

Error-handling is a critical part of web development. On one hand, developers need to ensure their applications validate input and raise errors appropriately. On the other hand it is also important to design a good user experience for when these errors occur.

### What are the objectives?
<!-- specific/measurable goal for students to achieve -->
*After this workshop, developers will be able to:*

- Use built-in ActiveRecord validation methods to validate database entries.
- Display errors in the view using Rails `flash` messages.


### Where should we be now?
<!-- call out the skills that are prerequisites -->
*Before this workshop, developers should already be able to:*

- Construct a basic Rails application

## Warmup

<details>
  <summary>What is validation?</summary>
  <br>
  <p>Validation is the process of checking to make sure any user input is of the proper type and format.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Where in our codebase can we validate user input?</summary>
  <br>
  <p>Developers can add validation handling on the client-side, at the model, and in the actual database.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why are there so many places that I can validate data? Are they all a good idea?</summary>
  <br>
  <p>Validation on the client-side is built to improve user experience. When a user fills out a form improperly, we should let them know immediately, rather than waiting for a full HTTP request/response to process.</p>
  <p>Validation at the model-level allows the application to prevent access to the database if the data isn't formatted correctly.</p>
  <p>Validation in the database is helpful if several different applications are using the same database and might have different standards of validation.</p>

## Error Handling

**The best error-handling strategy is a combination of both [client-side](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms/Data_form_validation) and server-side validations.**

Client-side validations ensure a good *user experience* by providing real-time, inline feedback on the user input. Server-side validations are **essential** for maintaining *database integrity*, especially if the client-side validations are ever compromised or purposely circumvented.

Today for server-side validations in Rails, we will be using [Active Record Validations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html). And for our client-side validations we will be building them with html5 attributes. [Data form validation MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms/Data_form_validation)

## Airplane App

For the purposes of this workshop there is a Rails app, `airplane_app` inside the repo that demonstrates the examples below.

The application was generated with: `rails new airplane_app -T -B -d postgresql` in order to prevent Rails from automatically creating tests (`-T`), prevent it from automatically bundling (`-B`), and set the database to postgres (`-d postgresql`).

Open this app, get it running, and write down at least 3 observations about the code base.

>Be sure to `bundle`, `rails db:create db:migrate db:seed`, and have postgres running before launching the application.

## Model Validations

Validations provide security against invalid or harmful data entering into the database. ActiveRecord provides a [convenient and easy set of built-in methods](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html) for validating model attributes, as well as the ability to define custom validator methods. An example of a built-in validation:

**app/models/airplane.rb**

```ruby
class Airplane < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :name, presence: true, uniqueness: true, length: {minimum: 6}
end
```

>Here, we're telling the model to validate itself before saving to the database. The `validates` method takes the model as it's first argument and configuration options as the remaining arguments.

In `rails console`, if you try adding a new airplane to the database where a name is

* not present
* a duplicate
* fewer than 6 characters

you'll get an error causing a `ROLLBACK`. Try, `Airplane.create(name: "747")`, which is a name of only three characters and see what happens.

What if you call `Airplane.create!(name: "747")`?

Alternatively, we can check any piece of data we are about to save with the `.valid?` method. So, instead of immediately calling`.create`. In that case, we can create a `.new` airplane instance in local memory (without saving it to the database), then asking if it's `.valid?` before calling `.save`.

```bash
> airplane = Airplane.new(name: "747")
=> #<Airplane id: nil, name: "747", description: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>
> airplane.valid?
=> false
```

The [`.valid?`](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html#valid-questionmark-and-invalid-questionmark) method returns `true` if the new record passes the model validations and `false` if it fails any validations.

Moreover, we can call [`.errors.full_messages`](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html#errors-add) to returns an array of user-friendly error messages, which is very useful and will be helpful for our user experience later.

```bash
> airplane.errors.full_messages
=> ["Name is too short (minimum is 6 characters)"]
```

Let's look at how we can display the error messages to the user so they know what went wrong if their input doesn't pass our validations.

### Challenge: Duplicates (2 mins)

Get the `airplane.errors.full_messages` to return `["Name has already been taken"]`

## Displaying Errors to the User

In the `airplane_app` what currently happens when we try to submit invalid data to the database via the `airplanes#new` view?

> As a user how are you supposed to know that something went wrong and what you are supposed to do about it?

In order to properly communicate what is happening behind the scenes, we can display flash messages to show them specific errors.

## Error Handling in Views: Flash Messages

Rails comes with a [flash hash](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/Flash.html), which stores a set of key/value pairs. `flash` is a variable that's accessible in our controllers and in our views. We'll set a key-value pair on the `flash` hash in the controller to be rendered later in the view.

Because we're trying to display an error message we get back from Active Record we can store the error message in the flash.

```ruby
flash[:error] = airplane.errors.full_messages
```

Add the above line into the `airplane#create` action. Make that line execute if the airplane isn't saved correctly and make sure it happens before the `:new` view is rendered again.

<details>
  <summary><strong>In which file should that line of code go?</strong></summary>
  <br>
  <p> **app/controllers/airplanes_controller.rb** </p>
</details>

```ruby
  def create
    @airplane = Airplane.new(airplane_params)
    if @airplane.save
      redirect_to @airplane
    else
      flash[:error] = airplane.errors.full_messages.join(" ")
      render :new
    end
  end
```
>Note: there's an error in the code above. Take a few moments to figure out what might go wrong and try to fix it before it does. If you feel stumped, copy and paste and test to see what happens when you put invalid entries into the form.


Just one last step! We've sent `flash` to the view, but we haven't rendered it yet. Let's do that in our `application.html.erb` layout, so we can render flash messages in *every* view:

<details>
  <summary><strong>In which file should the following piece of code go?</strong></summary>
  <br>
  <p> **app/views/layouts/application.html.erb** </p>
</details>

```html
<% flash.each do |name, msg| %>
<div><%= msg %></div>
<% end %>

<%= yield %>
```

> Note: run [`rails notes`](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html#notes) for further guidance on where to add the above lines of code.

## More Challenges

* After you've gotten a flash message to display an error from the `name` of your airplane, create a validation that we haven't used yet for the `description` attribute in your airplane model. Then make sure you can get a flash message to display when somebody generates bad input.
* Create a flash message that communicates to the user that they *have* successfully created a new entry in the db.
* Add a passenger model with at least 5 attributes and at least 3 novel validations.
* Add a controller and controller methods that will properly allow you to display any issues with creating an instance of the passenger model. (Note: you'll also need to create a form for the user to try to create passengers.)

## Closing

* Query Active Record for validation errors
* Handle errors appropriately
